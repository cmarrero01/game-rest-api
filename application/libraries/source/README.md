# PHP Source Query

## Description
This class was created to query game server which use the Source query protocol, this includes all source games, half-life 1 engine games and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3

The class also allows you to query servers using RCON although this only works for half-life 1 and source engine games.

[Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net) also uses Source RCON protocol, and this means you can use this class to send commands to your minecraft server while having engine set to source.
